Week 2 – Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data
📌 Project Overview
This project is part of Week 2 of the WeIntern Data Science & Machine Learning Internship.
The goal of this task is to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data and classify tweets into Positive, Neutral, and Negative categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression.

🎯 Objective
Analyze Twitter text data
Clean and preprocess tweets
Build a machine learning model to classify tweet sentiment
Visualize sentiment distribution

🗂 Dataset
Pre-collected Twitter dataset
Contains raw tweet text
Noise such as mentions, hashtags, and stopwords were removed during preprocessing

⚙️ Workflow
Data loading and exploration
Text cleaning and preprocessing
Sentiment labeling using TextBlob / NLTK
Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer
Model training using Logistic Regression
Model evaluation and visualization

🛠 Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy
NLTK / TextBlob
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn


📊 Visualizations
Sentiment distribution (Bar chart / Pie chart)

✅ Results
Successfully classified tweets into sentiment categories
Visual insights obtained from sentiment distribution
Logistic Regression provided effective baseline performance

🚀 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic NLP pipeline for sentiment analysis using traditional machine learning techniques and provides insights into public sentiment from Twitter data.
