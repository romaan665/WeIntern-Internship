Week 1 – House Price Prediction (Regression Model)
📌 Task Description

Train a regression model to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset or a similar dataset from Kaggle.

Challenges:

Feature scaling and encoding categorical data

Train/test split and model evaluation using RMSE or R²

Visualize model performance and key features

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

In this task, I built a machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using regression.
The workflow includes:

Data loading and preprocessing

Handling missing values

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Model training using Linear Regression

Evaluating performance with RMSE and R²

Visualizing correlations and prediction results 


Files Included

dataset.csv – The dataset used for training

house_price_model.py – The Python code for preprocessing, training, and evaluation
