📌 Task Description

Build a regression model to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset or a similar dataset from Kaggle.

Challenges

Perform feature scaling and encode categorical data

Split dataset into train/test sets

Evaluate the model using RMSE and R²

Visualize model performance and key features

Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

🧠 Project Overview

In this task, I developed a complete machine learning pipeline to predict house prices. The workflow includes:

Loading and exploring the dataset

Handling missing or inconsistent values

Applying StandardScaler for feature scaling

Training a Linear Regression model

Evaluating performance using:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

Creating visualizations for:

Actual vs Predicted values


🗂️ Files Included

dataset.csv — The dataset used for training

house_price_model.py — Python script for preprocessing, training, and evaluation

🚀 How to Run

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

python week1.py
