Week 2 – Credit Card Fraud Detection
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of Week 2 of the WeIntern Data Science & Machine Learning Internship.
The objective of this task is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning classification techniques. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud data, special techniques were applied to improve model performance.

🎯 Objective

Analyze credit card transaction data

Handle imbalanced datasets effectively

Build machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions

Compare model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics

Identify the most reliable model for fraud detection

🗂 Dataset

Publicly available Credit Card Transactions Dataset

Contains anonymized transaction features

Highly imbalanced target variable

0 → Legitimate transaction

1 → Fraudulent transaction

⚙️ Workflow
🔹 Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded transaction data using Pandas

Analyzed class imbalance and feature distributions

🔹 Data Preprocessing

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Split data into training and testing sets

Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance classes

🔹 Model Building

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

🔹 Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for optional visualization)

📊 Visualizations

Confusion Matrix

Class Distribution (Before & After SMOTE)

Model Performance Comparison

✅ Results

Successfully identified fraudulent transactions

SMOTE significantly improved model recall for fraud cases

Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression in handling complex patterns

High recall ensured fewer fraudulent transactions were missed

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a real-world machine learning pipeline for detecting credit card fraud using classification techniques.
By addressing class imbalance and evaluating models with the right metrics, the system provides reliable fraud detection results. This approach is widely applicable in financial security and risk management domains.
